    Alfredo Di Stéfano
Alfredo Di StéfanoIf the great Sir Bobby Charlton describes you as the most complete footballer he has ever seen, you're destined for greatness. Of course, he was far from the only one to be entranced by the supremely talented Alfredo Di Stéfano, nicked "The Blond Arrow". While not as flashy or technically gifted as some of his contemporaries, Di Stéfano's incredible versatility, stunning physical predispositions and leadership skills made him into one of the best players the game has ever seen. For his on-field achievements, Di Stéfano won two Ballon d'Or awards in 1957 and 1959, as well as the first and only Super Ballon d'Or in 1989.<br>
<br>
Di Stéfano joined Real in 1953. In a classic "the rich get richer" scenario, the addition of Di Stéfano turned Real into the most dominant club of its era, and possibly of all time. Along with other superstars such as Ferenc Puskás and Francisco Gento, Di Stéfano led Real to eight La Liga titles between 1953 and 1964.

Soon enough, the club's dominance spread to Europe. Starting with the inaugural competition in 1955 and up until 1960, Real Madrid made five consecutive European Cup finals, winning them all without much resistance. Di Stéfano made history by scoring in each of the five finals, thus establishing himself as the de facto leader of the greatest team in the world. In 1957 and 1959, he was named the European Footballer of the Year.<br>
